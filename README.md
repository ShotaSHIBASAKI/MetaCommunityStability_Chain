# MetaCommunityStability_Chain
Meta-community dynamics in a chain network to analyze how upstream affects downstream stability in gut microbiota

The codes here are used in the study by Shibasaki and Mitri (2022). These codes are used to generate meta-community simulations, perform analyses, and drow some figures. For the easy replication of the results, codes are summarized in a jupyter notebook
You can also find the csv files that contain the data used in the above study.
